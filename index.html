            A nebulizer is a device that turns the liquid medicine into a mist which is then inhaled through a mouthpiece or a mask. 
            Sometimes asthma medication is given through a nebulizer as well, so this information can benefit people living with asthma too.
            A nebulizer treatment may help reduce inflammation in the lungs or open airways, especially in the case of respiratory illnesses like asthma. 
            Nebulizer treatments may also benefit people with other respiratory diseases like COPD who have lung-related complications from a cold or flu.

            <ul>
                <li>Compressor: a power source that compresses room air which then breaks the liquid medication into tiny droplets (an aerosol) which can be breathed in. </li>
                <li>Nebuliser chamber: a plastic cylinder which holds the medication and is attached to the compressor by a plastic tube.</li>
                <li>a base that holds an air compressor. a small container for liquid medication. a tube that connects the air compressor to the medicationÂ container.</li>

            Most nebulizers work by using air compressors to create the mist containing the medicine. 
            A different kind, called an ultrasonic nebulizer, uses sound vibrations.
            Nebulizers are commonly used to treat respiratory conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis. 
            They are particularly useful for people who have difficulty using inhalers, such as young children or older adults. 
            Nebulizers are also often used in hospital settings to deliver medication to critically ill patients who cannot inhale medication on their own.</p>

            <h3>Types of nebulizer</h3>
            <p class="type-para">There are three main types of nebulizers:                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Jet.</strong>  This uses compressed gas to make an aerosol (tiny particles of medication in the air).</li>
                    <li><strong>Ultrasonic.</strong> This makes an aerosol through high-frequency vibrations. The particles are larger than with a jet nebulizer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mesh. </strong>Liquid passes through a very fine mesh to form the aerosol</li>
